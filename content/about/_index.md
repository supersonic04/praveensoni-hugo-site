Hi, I'm **Praveen Soni** â€” a systems thinker and consultant who helps operations-heavy teams solve real-world problems using data, automation, and AI.

By day, I lead digital modernization efforts in fire and emergency services. On the side, I run [Emberlytic](https://emberlytic.com), a part-time consulting practice focused on turning messy workflows into scalable systems.
